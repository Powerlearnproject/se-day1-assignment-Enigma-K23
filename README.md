Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Here are three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering:

### 1. **The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)**
The term "software engineering" was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference addressed the growing "software crisis," where projects were often late, over budget, and unreliable. It marked the beginning of viewing software development as an engineering discipline, emphasizing systematic and disciplined approaches[1](https://www.softwaretestingstuff.com/2007/09/brief-history-of-software-engineering.html).

### 2. **Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s)**
Structured programming emerged in the 1970s as a methodology to improve the clarity and quality of software. It advocated for the use of control structures like loops and conditionals instead of using goto statements, which made code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. This was a significant step towards more reliable and maintainable software[1](https://www.softwaretestingstuff.com/2007/09/brief-history-of-software-engineering.html).

### 3. **Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001)**
The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001, introducing Agile methodologies like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP). Agile emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback, allowing for iterative development and rapid adaptation to changing requirements. This revolutionized software development by promoting more efficient and responsive processes[1](https://www.softwaretestingstuff.com/2007/09/brief-history-of-software-engineering.html).

These milestones have significantly shaped the field of software engineering, leading to more reliable, efficient, and adaptable software development practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases that guide the development process from concept to completion. Here are the main phases:

### 1. **Planning**
In this initial phase, the project's goals, scope, and feasibility are defined. The team identifies the resources needed, potential risks, and creates a project plan. This phase sets the foundation for the entire development process[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

### 2. **Requirements Analysis**
During this phase, the team gathers and documents the specific requirements of the software. This involves understanding what the users need and expect from the software. The output is a detailed Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

### 3. **Design**
The design phase involves creating the architecture and design of the software. This includes defining the system components, interfaces, and data flow. The goal is to create a blueprint that guides the development process[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

### 4. **Coding**
In the coding phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built and implemented. It's crucial to follow coding standards and practices to ensure quality[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

### 5. **Testing**
Testing is conducted to identify and fix any bugs or issues in the software. This phase ensures that the software functions correctly and meets the requirements. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are performed[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

### 6. **Deployment**
Once the software has been tested and is ready for use, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves installing the software, configuring it, and making it available to users[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

### 7. **Maintenance**
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves monitoring the software, fixing any issues that arise, and making updates or improvements as needed. Maintenance ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time[1](https://www.harness.io/blog/software-development-life-cycle-phases).

These phases provide a structured approach to software development, ensuring that each aspect of the project is carefully planned, executed, and maintained.
